class Pred (object):

    """
    Pred takes a predicate function, i.e. a function that takes one argument,
    and returns a boolean that answers some True/False question about it.

    Don't use the "dunder" (double underscore) methods defined on this class,
    like __and__; instead use the operators they define, like &. Composition
    through these few boolean operations are the core purpose of this class.

    Example comparison functions:

        lt  = lambda n: lambda x: x <  n
        lte = lambda n: lambda x: x <= n
        eq  = lambda n: lambda x: x == n
        gte = lambda n: lambda x: x >= n
        gt  = lambda n: lambda x: x >  n

    Turned into functions that return predicates of one argument:

        isLT  = lambda n: Pred( lt(n))
        isLTE = lambda n: Pred(lte(n))
        isEq  = lambda n: Pred( eq(n))
        isGTE = lambda n: Pred(gte(n))
        isGT  = lambda n: Pred( gt(n))

    Predicates are composable via & (AND) and | (OR):

        # decide if x is (<2) OR (>6) OR (==4)
        (isLT(2) | isGT(6) | isEq(4)).run(x)

    Predicates are negatable via - (negation):

        # True only if x is NOT equal to 3
        (-isEq(3)).run(x)

        # note: dot notation binds tighter than negation, sadly,
        #       so you'll have to group the (-) with parentheses

    Predicates map:

        # convert [0-9] to bools; 2, 3, 7, and 8 are True
        map((isGT(1) & isLT(4) | isGT(6) & isLT(9)).run, xrange(10))

        # note: precedence matters, e.g. & binds tighter than |

    Predicates filter:

        # keep the numbers (<=2) OR (>6), but NOT 9
        filter((isLTE(2) | isGT(6) & -isEq(9)).run, xrange(10))

    Predicates are first class:

        # you can assign them to variables
        isValidWeekdayNum = isGTE(1) & isLTE(7)
        if (-isValidWeekdayNum).run(8):
            # the following will raise; 8 is invalid
            raise RuntimeError, "invalid weekday number"

        # you can also pass them to and return them from functions

    Predicates "fuse"

        Consider this line of code:

            filter(f, filter(g, xs))

        We have some xs, and we're first filtering them by some function, g,
        and then we're taking the result, and filtering it again by some
        function, f. In many languages, this would create an intermediate list
        to hold the results of the g filtering, which would then be passed to
        the f filtering. If we could instead 'fuse' f and g, by composing them
        together into a new function, we could give that function to filter,
        and traverse the list only once. This is how the composed predicates
        work here.

    Thoughts...

        We mentioned how one option for filtering is nesting filters, and how
        this can lead to the creatin of intermediary data structures, and
        increased time complexity through multiple passes. Composable filtering
        functions don't suffer these two issues, because they "fuse."

        "Fusion" is when chains of things, like mappings, filterings, and
        foldings (reducings), have their individual functionality composed
        together, so everything can happen in a single pass.

        Another option for composed filters is to custom code them, by writing
        functions that manually do all of the things you want, manually fusing
        away the extra space and time complexity (and then thinking up names
        for each). This is untenable after only a few filters exist, though, as
        the number of combinations of things you might ever need explodes, akin
        to trying to think of all the combinations of command line programs you
        might ever want.

        A third option is to create a domain specific language (DSL) around
        your filtering needs, and then write a parser that can turn queries in
        that language into code. This is a big undertaking, and requires a lot
        of micromanaging of the parser, tests, debugging, etc., to get working,
        and keep working as needs change. In contrast, composed predicates
        stack in any order, whenever and wherever you want. When you create a
        new one, you don't have to do anything for it to Just Workâ„¢ with all
        the existing ones.

        Composition of base predicates into more complex predicates, and even
        further composition of existing composed predicates gets around the
        issues listed above. Values are visited once, and all of the predicates
        in the composition are run internally, with the results combined in
        boolean fashion, with no intermediate structures.

        There's no need to write a ton of a la carte solutions. Just glue a few
        premade pieces together, as and when needed. If it turns out to be
        useful, give it a name. It's also easy to create new predicates.
        They're just functions that return a boolean. You can write them
        in-place using the "lambda" keyword.

        There's also no interoperation to consider. Everything is separate,
        composable pieces, each being simple to create and test in isolation,
        and automatically usable with every other piece.

        Finally, the code needed to make this work is simple to test, easy to
        reason about, and vanishingly small.
